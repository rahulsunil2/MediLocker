In order to reduce the incidence of a false positive
result, the CDC recommends that all s/co ratios
between 1.0 and 10.9 be confirmed by a more specific
supplemental or PCR testing. LabCorp offers HCV Ab
w/Reflex ro Verification test #144065.

Acceptable specimens for this test are male urethral swab,
endocervical swab and liquid based pap specimens, vaginal swabs in
APTIMA transports and first void urine. See online Directory of
Services for test number for rectal and pharyngeal specimens.

Positive       >1.09
Note: Negative indicates no antibodies detected to
HSV-1. Equivocal may suggest early infection. If
clinically appropriate, retest at later date. Positive
indicates antibodies detected to HSV-1; coinfection
with HSV-2 cannot be excluded without type specific
testing.
